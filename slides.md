# Bird Hat Grift Club and the Paradox of Literary NFTs

## Electronic Literature Organization Annual Conference

John T. Murray
July 12, 2025

Note: Welcome everyone. Today I'll be exploring how Josh Drummond's Bird Hat Grift Club exemplifies a new form of critical digital art that uses NFT mechanisms to critique NFT culture itself.

## The Paradox

> "The world's first anti-NFT NFT scheme, designed from the ground up to fail"

- 10,000 procedurally generated birds
- 450+ hand-drawn elements
- **Critical intervention through participation**

Note: This work presents a fascinating paradox - it's an NFT project that actively undermines NFT culture, using superior technical execution to highlight the emptiness of typical NFT ventures.

Note: The website mimics typical NFT project aesthetics while explicitly calling itself a "grift" - complete transparency as artistic strategy.

---

## Theoretical Framework

### McLuhan's "The Medium is the Message"

- The blockchain mechanism **is** the artistic statement
- Technology infrastructure becomes content
- Critical engagement through the very systems being critiqued

Note: McLuhan's theory proves particularly relevant here - the NFT technology itself, rather than the bird images, carries the critical message.

---

## The Rescue Mechanism

### Inverse Value Proposition

1. Traditional art purchase "rescues" a bird
2. Rescued birds permanently removed from NFT pool
3. Supporting conventional art **reduces** NFT availability

### [Placeholder: Rescue Mechanism Diagram]

Note: This mechanism creates an elegant inversion - the more successful the traditional art sales, the fewer NFTs can exist.

### Technical Sophistication as Critique

- Exceeds typical NFT projects in quality
- 450+ hand-drawn elements vs. typical 50-100
- Demonstrates effort mismatch in NFT space

Note: By over-delivering on technical execution, Drummond highlights how most NFT projects under-deliver while promising revolutionary value.

---

## Environmental & Economic Critiques

### The Carbon Question
- Average NFT: ~1 month EU electricity usage
- Ethereum's PoS transition: -99.9% energy
- Fundamental wastefulness remains

### Market Dynamics
- 95% of NFT collections worth $0 (2023)
- Pyramid scheme mechanics
- Artificial scarcity in digital media

Note: These critiques form the backdrop against which Bird Hat Grift Club operates, making its satirical stance more pointed.

---

## [Placeholder: NFT Marketplace Listing]

*Insert screenshot of Bird Hat Grift Club NFTs listed on OpenSea or similar platform*

### Participatory Critique in Action

- Listed on real NFT marketplaces
- Uses authentic smart contracts
- Engages actual crypto infrastructure

Note: The project doesn't just comment on NFT culture from outside - it actively participates in and subverts it from within.

---

## Literary NFT Platforms

### Emerging Ecosystem
- **Book.io**: 130,000+ NFTs sold, Ingram partnership
- **Creatokia**: "Digital Originals" with unique covers
- **Readl**: No crypto wallet required, 98% royalties

### Scholarly Implications
- Citation instability
- Access inequality
- Preservation uncertainty

Note: These platforms raise fundamental questions about how literary works should exist in blockchain contexts.

---

## Cryptopoetry Classification?

### Characteristics of Cryptopoetry
- Emphasis on emotional connection
- Covers "entire spectrum of human existence"
- High collectibility potential

### Bird Hat Grift Club as Anti-Cryptopoetry?
- Procedural generation vs. human emotion
- Satirical intent vs. sincere expression
- Critical framework vs. aesthetic focus

Note: Can work that critiques the very concept of NFT ownership be classified within NFT genre categories?

---

## [Placeholder: Project Roadmap Parody]

*Insert screenshot of Bird Hat Grift Club's satirical roadmap mocking typical NFT project promises*

### Subverting NFT Conventions

- Parodies roadmaps and utility promises
- "Designed from the ground up to fail"
- Transparency as artistic strategy

Note: By explicitly stating its nature as a "grift," the project removes the deception inherent in many NFT schemes.

---

## Preservation Paradox

### Electronic Literature Principles
- Open access tradition
- Format migration strategies
- Community-based preservation

### NFT Resistance
- Proprietary infrastructure
- Ownership-based access
- Platform dependency

Note: Bird Hat Grift Club exists at the intersection of these contradictory impulses.

---

## Critical NFT Art Precedents

### Damien Hirst's "The Currency" (2021)
- Choose physical artwork OR NFT
- 5,149 chose physical, 4,851 digital
- Binary choice as critique

### MSCHF Projects
- System exploitation strategies
- "Severed Spots" - cutting up $30K Hirst
- Using market logic against itself

Note: These works establish a tradition of using participation as critique that Bird Hat Grift Club extends.

---

## [Placeholder: Individual Bird Character Close-up]

*Insert detailed image of a single bird character showing the hand-drawn elements and satirical details*

### Aesthetic Excess as Commentary

- Over-engineered for disposable content
- Quality inversely related to value proposition
- Craft in service of critique

Note: The careful attention to visual detail contrasts sharply with the project's stated worthlessness.

---

## Theoretical Implications

### Immanent Critique
- Criticism from within the system
- Using native mechanisms and language
- More effective than external commentary

### Productive Paradox
- Contradiction as generative force
- Participation without complicity
- Integrity through transparency

Note: This approach offers a model for how artists can engage problematic systems while maintaining critical distance.

---

## Future Directions

### For Electronic Literature
1. Hybrid preservation strategies
2. Critical blockchain engagement
3. New economic models for authors

### For Scholarly Practice
1. Developing citation standards for NFTs
2. Preserving critical digital art
3. Theorizing participatory critique

Note: Bird Hat Grift Club points toward new possibilities for critical digital art practice.

## [Placeholder: Community Response Documentation]

*Insert screenshots of community reactions, rescue purchases, or social media engagement*

### Impact and Reception

- Traditional art sales success
- NFT pool reduction in action
- Community understanding of critique

Note: The project's success lies not in NFT sales but in its ability to generate critical discourse.

---

## Conclusions

### The Productive Paradox
- Using NFT mechanisms to critique NFTs
- Technical sophistication in service of satire
- Transparency as artistic strategy

### Broader Implications
- Models for critical engagement with problematic systems
- Questions about medium, message, and meaning
- Future of literary works in blockchain contexts

Note: Bird Hat Grift Club demonstrates how artists can maintain integrity while engaging with and critiquing emerging technologies.
